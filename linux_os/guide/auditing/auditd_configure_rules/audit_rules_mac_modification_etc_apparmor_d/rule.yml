title: 'Record Events that Modify the System''s Mandatory Access Controls (/etc/apparmor.d)'

description: |-
    {{{ describe_audit_rules_watch("/etc/apparmor.d/", "MAC-policy") }}}

rationale: |-
    The system's mandatory access policy (Apparmor) should not be
    arbitrarily changed by anything other than administrator action. All changes to
    MAC policy should be audited.

severity: medium

ocil_clause: 'the system is not configured to audit attempts to change files within the /etc/apparmor.d directory'

ocil: |-
    To determine if the system is configured to audit changes to its Apparmor
    configuration files, run the following command:
    <pre>$ sudo auditctl -l | grep "dir=/etc/apparmor.d"</pre>
    If the system is configured to watch for changes to its Apparmor
    configuration, a line should be returned (including
    <tt>perm=wa</tt> indicating permissions that are watched).

template:
    name: audit_rules_watch
    vars:
        path: /etc/apparmor.d
        key: MAC-policy
